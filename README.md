# notion-utils

These will probably always be one-offs, so think of this more as useful starting points for further customizations / scripts that need to be run.

## Usage

- Create or reuse an existing [Notion integration](https://developers.notion.com/docs/getting-started)
- Install the dependendencies here

```
yarn
```

- Run the script

```
NOTION_TOKEN=<token> yarn go
```
